# Stadium #3: Acrisure Stadium and Our First Northern Trip

**Stadium #3: Acrisure Stadium, Pittsburgh, PA**  
*Seahawks vs Steelers - September 14, 2025*

---

Stadium number three took us north for the first time. After learning our lesson about Texas heat in September, Gene and I decided to flip our strategy: hit the northern cities early in the season, save the southern ones for later.

Pittsburgh in mid-September turned out to be perfect timing.

## The AFC Strategy

We're also being strategic about which teams we visit. We want to hit **AFC teams first** because Seattle and the Saints will play them the least often. These matchups are the hardest to schedule around, so we're knocking them out early in our journey.

Pittsburgh checked both boxes: northern location, AFC team. Perfect.

## Solo Exploring: Gene's Work Gets in the Way

Gene had work commitments and couldn't join until Sunday, driving in right before the game. So I had a few days to explore Pittsburgh on my own.

I stayed at an **Airbnb in Northside** and spent my time wandering the city, eating well, and discovering what makes Pittsburgh unique.

### Downtown Pittsburgh and PPG Architecture

**Downtown Pittsburgh** blew me away. The architecture, especially the **PPG (Pittsburgh Plate Glass) buildings**, is stunning. The city has this beautiful mix of old industrial heritage and modern design. I loved walking around just looking up at the buildings.

### Primanti Bros: Fries Belong in Sandwiches

On a coworker's recommendation, I ate at **Primanti Bros**, the legendary Pittsburgh sandwich shop.

I ordered the **Pastrami and Cheese**, and it was amazing. Yes, they literally put the fries **in the sandwich**. And you know what? It works. Perfectly. I don't know why more places don't do this.

### Point State Park: Under Construction, Still Beautiful

**Point State Park** was under construction because Pittsburgh is hosting the **2026 NFL Draft**. Even with the work happening, it was still a beautiful spot. Standing at the point where the rivers come together, the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio, was stunning. You can see why this location was so important historically.

### Randyland: A Kaleidoscope of Joy

One of the most unique stops was **Randyland**, this incredibly colorful house covered in wild, hodgepodge art made from toys and found objects. It's chaotic, joyful, and unlike anything I've ever seen.

I got to talk to the owner, Randy, who's also autistic. His energy and passion for what he's created was infectious. The whole place is just pure creative expression, and I loved it.

### The City That Sleeps Early

One thing I noticed: **Pittsburgh shuts down early**. By 9-10 PM, things get quiet. I was able to find a bar, but I was almost right on top of it before I noticed it because there was so little noise spilling out.

It's very different from the New Orleans bars I grew up with, where you can hear the party from blocks away. Not better or worse, just different. Pittsburgh has a more subdued nightlife vibe, at least in the Northside.

### Mattress Factory: Modern Art in an Old Factory

I visited the **Mattress Factory**, a modern art museum, which used to be an actual mattress factory. Modern art isn't usually my thing, but this place was cool. The installations were creative and thought-provoking, and the space itself added to the experience.

### Strip District: Steelers Everything

The **Strip District** is a collection of shops, markets, and **LOTS of Steelers clothing for sale**. Black and gold everywhere. The city bleeds Steelers pride.

I found **Posman Books**, a bookstore that's also an ice cream shop. I was in heaven. Books and ice cream in one place? That's my ideal afternoon.

### Wigle Whiskey: A Rye Revelation

I have a large whisk(e)y collection and usually prefer bourbons, but I stopped by **Wigle Whiskey** for a tasting. Surprisingly, I **preferred their Rye over their Bourbon**. Maybe it's because I was up north, but the rye just hit different. It was smooth, flavorful, and made me rethink my bourbon bias.

### The Incline Adventure and Unexpected Friends

I took the **Monongahela Incline** up to get a higher view of downtown. The view was incredible with the rivers, bridges, the city skyline all laid out below.

I planned to walk to the **Duquesne Incline** to go back down, and along the way, I made conversation with a couple who was heading to **Le Mont**, a restaurant with an amazing view.

They invited me to join them for a drink. We had a great conversation over incredible views of the city. Turns out they were celebrating their anniversary and were also in town for the game. They gave me their seat info so we could connect at the stadium.

Sometimes the best travel moments are the unplanned ones.

### Animation Mixtape at the Harris Theater

I saw **"Animation Mixtape"** at the **Harris Theater**, which happened to be showing while I was in town and featured one of my favorite animators.

The show was a potpourri of animations.  Some fell flat, some were hilarious, and some were genuinely thought provoking. It was a fun, eclectic experience.

### Walking Home: A Safe City

After all my exploring, I walked back from downtown to my Airbnb in Northside. **I felt safe the entire time.** Pittsburgh has a welcoming, approachable vibe, even late at night.

## Game Day: Gene Arrives

Sunday morning, Gene drove in and parked by my Airbnb. We grabbed breakfast at **Lindos Restaurant**, which felt like an old-school diner. A solid breakfast was exactly what we needed to start the day.

### Tailgating with Steelers Nation

We talked to a bunch of people who were tailgating, and the Steelers fans were welcoming and passionate. Black and gold everywhere.

We ran into a couple where the husband had already **visited every stadium to see the Steelers play**. We were impressed and glad to know we weren't the only ones crazy enough to attempt this kind of journey.

### Pre-Game Highlights

We got to see the **Fred Rogers Memorial Statue**, a touching tribute to Mr. Rogers, who's beloved in Pittsburgh.

There was also a **parade of lowriders** showing off before the game, which got everyone's attention. It was fun to watch and added to the festive atmosphere.

One thing that blew my mind: instead of parking at the stadium, some people were able to **park their boats right by the stadium** and tailgate from there. I'm still wondering if they had to pay for that.

## Acrisure Stadium: Outdoor Football by the Rivers

**Acrisure Stadium** is outdoor, sunny, and has a **great view of the rivers**. It's a classic football setting, open air, natural light, and the industrial beauty of Pittsburgh as a backdrop.

Here's the thing though: the stadium is officially called Acrisure Stadium, but **every local we talked to called it Heinz Field**. That's what it was called for years, and old habits die hard. The ketchup bottle may be gone from the scoreboard, but it's clearly not gone from people's hearts.

I was wearing my **gold Saints shirt**, which looked close enough to Steelers colors that I'm not even sure people noticed I wasn't rooting for the home team.

We met up with my friends from the restaurant, the couple celebrating their anniversary, and enjoyed the game together.

## The Game: Seahawks Win

Before kickoff, we let our neighbors know that we were there to enjoy the game and promised to be good neighbors. Steelers fans appreciated that.

There was a **military helicopter flyover** that got the crowd hyped.

Even though he was on the opposing side, it was good to see a legend like **Aaron Rodgers play live**. Watching a future Hall of Famer in person is always special, regardless of which team you're rooting for.

**Seattle won 31-17**, which made Gene very happy. His Seahawks got the road win, and he was grinning the whole way out of the stadium.

## Post-Game: Quick Exit

After the game, we had to drive by **Randyland** to show it to Gene because it was so close to the Airbnb and so incredibly unique. He loved it.

Unfortunately, we didn't have time for much else. I had to fly home, and Gene had to fly out for another work week.

At the **Pittsburgh International Airport**, I spotted a **really cool construction installation robot**, some kind of art piece that caught my attention on the way out. A fitting end to a city that blends industry and creativity so well.

## What We Learned

Stadium #3 taught us:

**Northern cities in September are perfect.** Warm, sunny, and comfortable.  Without the oppressive heat.

**Always pack sunscreen.** Even in the north, sunny game days will get you.

**AFC teams first is a smart strategy.** Since both Seahawks and Saints are in the NFC, these matchups are rare for our teams, so prioritizing them early makes sense.

**Pittsburgh is full of hidden gems.** From Randyland to the inclines to Primanti Bros, the city surprised me at every turn.

**Unplanned moments are the best.** Meeting that couple at the incline and joining them for drinks was a highlight I never could have planned.

**Steelers fans travel too.** Meeting someone who'd visited every stadium to follow their team was inspiring.

## The Journey Continues

Three stadiums down. Twenty-seven to go.

We've been to the West Coast, the South, and now the North. Each city teaches us something new about America and about how to be smarter travelers.

Gene and I are learning as we go.
